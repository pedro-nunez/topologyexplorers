	<p>You are a team of topologists-explorers in an uncharted land.
	According to some history books, an ancient civilization famous for its infrastructures used to live around here.
	The story goes that some space-time anomalies eventually led to the collapse of this civilization: black holes started spawning across the land, in some cases even at the heart of big cities, and their population got severly decimated.
	Nowadays the descendants of the few survivors still live on this land, but all visible traces of the old civilization and its infrastructures got erased by time.
	</p>
	<p>You would like to find out more about that ancient civiliztion and its infrastructures.
	According to some locals, one of the greatest infrastructures was a path that traversed the land, forming a big loop from the point in which you decided to establish your base camp.
	Your goal is to explore the land, find all black holes and reconstruct the old path, which you hope to be able to do by asking the locals around.
	Since you are topologists, you only really care about how the black holes affected the fundamental group of the land and about the resulting homotopy class of the old path.

	<ul>
	    <li>Units of length are measured with respect to the taxi distance in what follows.</li>
	    <li>Group members cannot be further apart than 3 units during a daily exploration.
		<strong>Hint-Warning:</strong> too much forking may lead to sticky situations.</li>
	    <li>If the previous rule is broken, all players in a group will go back to were they previously were and will lose one hour in the procsess.</li>
	    <li>The daily exploration lasts only up to 16 hours; it takes 1 hour to move 1 unit of distance in any direction.</li>
