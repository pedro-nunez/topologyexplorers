	<p>You are a team of topologists-explorers in an uncharted land.
	According to some history books, an ancient civilization famous for its infrastructures used to live around here.
	The story goes that some space-time anomalies eventually led to the collapse of this civilization: black holes started spawning across the land, in some cases even at the heart of big cities, and their population got severly decimated.
	Nowadays the descendants of the few survivors still live on this land, but all visible traces of the old civilization and its infrastructures got erased by time.
	</p>
	<p>You would like to find out more about that ancient civiliztion and its infrastructures.
	According to some locals, one of the greatest infrastructures was a path that traversed the land, forming a big loop from the point in which you decided to establish your base camp.
	Your goal is to explore the land, find all black holes and reconstruct the old path, which you hope to be able to do by asking the locals around.
	Since you are topologists, you only really care about how the black holes affected the fundamental group of the land and about the resulting homotopy class of the old path.

	<ul>
	    <li>The daily exploration lasts only up to 16 hours; it takes 1 hour to move in any of the 4 cardinal directions.</li>
		<li>The daily exploration takes place in randomly assigned BBB groups.</li>
	    <li>Group members cannot be further apart than 3 units (taxi-distance) during a daily exploration.
		<strong>Hint-Warning:</strong> too much forking may lead to sticky situations.</li>
	    <li>If the previous rule is broken, all players in a group should go back to were they previously were and will lose one hour in the procsess.</li>
	    <li>If something funny happens and you don't know how to get out of it, start the game over from the base camp (e.g. click the link again) and then try to get back to the place you were before without stopping to answer any questions along the way.</li>

	<p>Many thanks to Daniel Fix, Vera Gahlen, Sebastian Goette, Mauro Sanchiz and David Trillo for their useful suggestions!</p></br>

	<p>This game was inspired by a &quot;Mauro and Guille's non graphic adventure&quot;, a small game developed some years ago by Mauro Sanchiz and Guillermo S&aacute;nchez.
	The game used windows folders and shortcuts with small .txt files for flavour.</p></br>

	<p>About the questions:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>The ones about Freiburg and its history are directly taken from the <a href="https://www.breisgau-geschichtsverein.de/de/freiburg-quiz/archiv.php">Freiburg Quiz-Archiv</a> of the Breisgau-Geschichtsverein Schauinsland.</li>
	    <li>Many of the science questions were directly suggested by David Trillo or directly taken from the 2017 edition of &quot;Saber y Beber&quot;, a quiz-contest at the Complutense University of Madrid which he helped to organize.</li>
	    <li>The knot puzzles were also David's idea.</li>
	    <li>Many of the math puzzles and problems are directly taken from Arthur Engel's 1998 book &quot;Problem-Solving Strategies&quot;.</li>
