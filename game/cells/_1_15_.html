    <p>You meet a scientist who decides to test you before sharing information with you.</br>
    &quotWater is poured into a \(1m^{3}\) cubic container from a height of \(2m\) and from a tap with a circular opening of \(2cm\) in diameter.</br>
    The container sits on top of a scale that was calibrated to measure \(0kg\) when the container was empty.</br>
    Let's say the water pours continuously and the container was empty when it started pouring.</br>
    If we want to end up with \(5kg\) of water inside the container, what should the scale read at the time in which we decide to close the tap and stop the flow of water?&quot</p>
