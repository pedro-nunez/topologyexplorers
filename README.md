# Topology Explorers

HTML game for virtual Oberharmersbach 2021

## (Hopefully) future todo list

Some things that I would like to improve or implement at some point in the future if there is time to do so:

- Use torus instead of Klein bottle
- Make the game more easily reusable: script to generate random maps taking size as input, script to randomize questions taking a list of questions and answers as an input, script for the theorem stuff taking list of names and favourite theorems as an input
- (Maybe) Chess/go problems using game grid as board
- (Maybe) Improve multiplayer game experience: maybe prompt users to enter name and fav theorem themselves, do the randomized groups automatically, have automatic day counters for the group and hour counters for each player, keep track of distance between group members automatically... All this sounds a bit complicated and it is not clear to me that it would add so much to the game experience as to make it worth the effort
