# Topology Explorers

JavaScript game for virtual Oberharmersbach 2021

# TO-DO

- [x] Add conditional statement to navigation buttons: if about to enter in a forbidden area, change the functionality instead!
- [ ] Create secondary camps. History: seems like an abandoned base camp of a previous team of explorers. There is a hellicopter with a full tank. You can use it to move back and forth between base camps!
- [ ] Think of names for the creatures.
- [ ] Near the start: a creature telling you about the name of the area ("invariant planes"?). Give option to say: "cool thanks" (creature says btw the path is here). Maybe input the answer as a text and look for the string "thank". If so what was chosen, creature leaves and buttons disappear for 5 min.
- [ ] Create geography flavours.
